# Obstacle-Detecting Car

I created an obstacle-detecting car using a MSP430F5529 microprocessor, HC-SRF04 Ultrasonic Ranger, SN754410 H-driver, two DC gear motors attached to a ZK-2WD (wheeled robotic platform), and piezoelectric beeper. A program was written in C to implement its functionality. Please see "Car.png" for a picture of the completed project.
